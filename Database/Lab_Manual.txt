**) SQL Constraints:
--------------------
SQL constraints are used to specific rules for the data in a table. Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraints and the data action, the action is aborted.
The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:
-> NOT NULL: Ensures that a column can not have a null value.
-> UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column are different.
-> PRIMARY KEY: A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE.
-> FOREIGN KEY: Uniquely identifies a row/record in another table.
-> CHECK: Ensures that all values in a column satisfies a specific condition.
-> DEFAULT: Sets a default value for a column when no values specified.
-> INDEX: Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.
-> AUTO_INCREMENT: Auto increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.Often this is the primary key field which we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.
